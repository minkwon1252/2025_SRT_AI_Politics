🏛️ SRT - AI Session Politics

Welcome to the 2025 SRT AI Politics session.

In this session, you are entrusted with the strategic leadership of your nation. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to secure your country’s success—whether through cooperation, competition, or isolation—in a world where artificial intelligence is becoming a defining force.

As a policymaker, you will shape your nation's AI strategy at home and abroad—crafting domestic policies and negotiating international cooperation, both of which directly impact the growth of influential AI research and the emergence of SOTA(State-of-the-Art) AI models.

Along the way, you must navigate the geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, deciding where your nation's loyalties lie—or choosing to remain neutral.

======================================================================================
Your primary mission: Secure your country’s success in AI development.
Your secondary mission: Since this is SRT AI Politics, aim to surpass the US and China in AI model development by cooperation (Sum of SRT > US or China).

You can choose to cooperate, compete, or remain neutral toward other nations. Key phases and concepts:

    AI model
        Development of landmark AI systems like ChatGPT by your nation. This is your #1 target.
        Models increase via three routes: accumulation of AI papers, cooperation, and luck.
        As of 2025: US has 40, China has 15, your nation has none.
    AI paper
        Production of notable AI research papers, your #2 target.
        Paper growth is shaped by domestic policies, cooperation, and random events.
        As of 2025: US has 3200, China has 2000, your nation has below 200.

    Policy Phase
      Set domestic AI policies to determine base paper growth (+N papers/round).
    Cooperation Phase
      Negotiate cooperative parameters with other nations, affecting model and paper growth.
    Events
      Random domestic or international events that affect AI progress.
      After domestic events, you can adjust policies. Will you trust or sabotage your partners?
    Summary Phase
      Review AI model and paper growth, and see global standings at the end of each round.
