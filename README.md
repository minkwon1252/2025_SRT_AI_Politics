🏛️ SRT - AI Session Politics

Welcome to the 2025 SRT AI Politics session.

In this session, you are entrusted with the strategic leadership of your nation. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to secure your country’s success—whether through cooperation, competition, or isolation—in a world where artificial intelligence is becoming a defining force.

As a policymaker, you will shape your nation's AI strategy at home and abroad—crafting domestic policies and negotiating international cooperation, both of which directly impact the growth of influential AI research and the emergence of SOTA(State-of-the-Art) AI models.

Along the way, you must navigate the geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, deciding where your nation's loyalties lie—or choosing to remain neutral.
