📘 AI Policy Simulation Game – ReadMe.txt

🎯 GOAL OF THE GAME
You are the policy leader of one of four countries: Japan, Korea, Taiwan, or Mongolia.
Your mission is to:
- Maximize your own AI paper output and notable AI model count — which one you value more is up to you.
- AND/OR help your East Asian coalition collectively surpass China or the U.S.

Choose: Dominate alone? Or win together? 

🧩 HOW THE GAME WORKS

Each round includes 5 phases:

1. Parameter Declaration
   - Adjust your hidden parameters (e.g., Education Investment, Semiconductor strength)
   - Keep your total score under 100

2. Cooperative Agreements
   - Form alliances using cooperation parameters (e.g., Data Shared, Joint Project)
   - You only have 30 points to spend — use them wisely
   - Think Prisoner’s Dilemma: will your partners betray you? 
If you and partner agree to share and both set Sharing_Tendency or willing_to_cooperate high both thrive. But you will be betrayed when they didn't set sharing values enough. 

3. Event Triggers
   - Each player picks 1 domestic event
   - The game master picks 1 international events and 1 Game Theory(PD,SH,CG) events
   - Events increase (or decrease!) AI models and paper points based on your parameters and alliances

4. Results Update
   - Your AI paper output is calculated using a formula based on hidden parameters
   - AI model count is based on a Gaussian distribution (don’t worry — we do the math) using AI paper output as σ^2
   - Event bonuses or penalties — along with your stance against the G2 — are applied.

5. Strategic Revision Phase
   - Reflect, regret, renegotiate
   - The game continues to the next round...

🛠 WHAT YOU CONTROL
- 🔒 Hidden Parameters (like AI Investment Focus, Electricity Access)
- 🤝 Cooperative Deals with other countries (share or deceive?)
- 🗳 Domestic Event Choice — pick one every round

🧠 WHAT TO THINK ABOUT
- How can you boost your country's independent performance — maximizing output without relying on others?
- Will you share compute and data... or use it by yourself?
- Do you value short-term gains... or long-term influence?
- Will you align with the U.S. or China... or build a third superpower?

📝 TIPS
- Maximize synergy between your hidden parameters and events
- Watch your paper growth curve — it determines AI model potential
- Not all cooperation is good — think about strategic timing
- Expect betrayal. Reward trust. Manipulate wisely.
